    Sometimes I think that my excessive change in mood is a bad thing when I feel it creating a distance between my friends and I. But then I remember that the distance is only apparent in some of my relationships and I am reminded that God is constantly cutting out the people from your life who do not match up to your goals and habits and are just plain not good for your physicallity, mentality and spirituality. And sometimes I'm not sure whether it's God or just me being difficult but then I remember how much he's blessed me and loves me and I know that regardless of my dificultness, those who are meant to be with me, <italics>will</italics> be with me in the end.</p>
